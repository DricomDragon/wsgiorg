  test.wsgi is a WSGI test app showing whether your WSGI environment is
  working (and also outputs some interesting informations like Python
  version, sys.path, WSGI environment, etc.). It can be directly used for
  mod_wsgi and easily for all other WSGI servers. When started directly
  from command line, it tries to use wsgiref's simple server to serve the
  application.
